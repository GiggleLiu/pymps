# MPS in Python
## Description
Tensor, Matrix Product State, Matrix Product Operator utilities in python.

## Install
#### prerequisites
Python 2.7
It is highly recomended to use Anaconda https://www.continuum.io/downloads/ to get **numpy** and **scipy** installed.
Also, package **tba** and **blockmatrix** are needed as supports, both could be found in my repositories.

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/GiggleLiu/pymps.git
  $ cd pymps & python setup.py
```

## Run Samples
Run in a terminal
```
  $ python sample_tensor.py
  $ python sample_mps.py
  $ python sample_bmps.py  #the block version.
```
